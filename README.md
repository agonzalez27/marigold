#Project 3 | MARIGOLD.Life

###MARIGOLD.life description
The death of a loved one is one of the most difficult life events anyone can face.  In addition to the emotional aspects of death, there are many logistical and financial pitfalls as well.  When a loved one passes away, many decisions have to be made within hours including what funeral home will be used, what kind of funeral service will be carried out, and how much one will spend.  Many times, due to the emotional state people can get taken advantage of.  MARIGOLD.life provides information to families about their local funeral homes including customer ratings, types of services offered, and cost of services.  By using MARIGOLD.life, customers can save time and money as well as make sound decisions during one of the most difficult times of their lives.  

###Technologies Used
In order to complete this project, I will use Angular for the front-end.  Mongo for the database.  Express will be the framework.  And nodejs for the back-end.  I will also use the Yelp API for funeral home ratings.
